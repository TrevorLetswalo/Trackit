Built End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline
Stages of DevOps architecture :
1️⃣ Plan
▪︎Define the project goals, features, and tasks.
▪︎Teams collaborate and follow Agile methods to stay organized and efficient.
2️⃣ Code
▪︎Developers write code using version control tools like Git.
▪︎ This Helps to track changes, fix bugs, and manage code across teams.
3️⃣ Build
▪︎Code is compiled and turned into executable software. 
4️⃣ Test
▪︎Testing is an analytical process to check if the software works correctly.
▪︎It helps to find problems early and make sure everything is ready before release.
5️⃣ Release
▪︎The software is packaged and prepared for deployment.
▪︎Automated tools handle this, but production releases may still be manual for safety.
6️⃣ Deploy
▪︎Code is moved into the live environment (like staging or production).
7️⃣ Operate
▪︎Dev and Ops teams collaborate continuously to keep systems stable.
▪︎They monitor performance, manage servers, and handle incidents together.
8️⃣ Monitor
▪︎Continuous monitoring helps spot problems early.
▪︎Tools like Splunk track logs, health, and system performance to improve future updates.
